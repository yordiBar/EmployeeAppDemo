## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run and develop the EmployeeAppDemo as a Blazor Server application, you need to have the following tools and software installed on your machine:

- **.NET SDK**: The application is built with .NET, so you will need the .NET SDK. The version required depends on the specific .NET version used in the project (e.g., .NET 6 or .NET 7). You can download the appropriate .NET SDK version from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

- **Visual Studio**: While you can use any editor, Visual Studio 2019 or later is recommended for Blazor Server applications for its integrated development environment tailored for .NET applications. Make sure to install the "ASP.NET and web development" workload. You can download Visual Studio from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

- **SQL Server**: If the application uses SQL Server for data storage, ensure SQL Server is installed and running. SQL Server Express is a free version that can be used for development purposes. Download it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).

- **Git**: To clone the repository, you'll need Git installed. If you don't already have Git, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
